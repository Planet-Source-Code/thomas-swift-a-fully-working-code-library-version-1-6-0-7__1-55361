### Description

A working code library that users can keep & organize a code collection within. Tuns of features !!! This version has a completly revamped data file format that is not compatible with my original version of this program. I found out that the original formating was bugy. This format has been tested with over a meg of data. The program has room for more improvement. The declairs also need work. Enjoy !!!
